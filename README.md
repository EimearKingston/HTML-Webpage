# HTML_Webpage
HTML webpage describing the lives of Henry VIII and his wives and daughters. Project to showcase HTML and CSS skill.  

The homepage makes use of CSS to change the size and background colour of a menu option when the mouse hovers over it.

The menu appears thereafter in the header once any other page of the website is accessed. Other pages in the website use CSS to float images to the left of paragraphs
and to install a specific font to the text.
