            <h2>Childhood</h2>
            <p>Elizabeth I was born in September of 1533 to parents King Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn. She was named after
                both her maternal and paternal grandmothers. Her birth was greatly significant because of its
                disappointment. A boy had been predicted during the pregnancy and their was some displeasure after
                Elizabeth's birth. When she was less than three years old, her mother, Anne Boleyn, was beheaded and
                Elizabeth herself was declared illegitimate. The young princess was sent away from court where she was
                raised by servants and governesses. Elizabeth moved in and out of Henry's favour throughout her
                childhood.
                Most time was spent in various royal residences. She was one of the most well educated women of her
                time,
                having been able to fluently speak a myriad of languages.
            </p>
            <h2>Succession</h2>
            <p>There was controversy concerning Elizabeth's birthright throughout her father's reign. When her mother
                was
                beheaded, the young girl lost her right to the crown. However Henry VIII's opinion over his children
                changed
                continuously as he became older. Before his death, the king rewrote his will to allow both of his
                estranged
                daughters inherit the crown should their brother die before them. However this eventuality arrived far
                sooner than anticipated. Elizabeth's younger brother Edward VI died at age 15, in 1533. Rather than Mary
                I
                being appointed Queen, a discrepancy led to Lady Jane Grey being crowned Queen, albeit for nine days
                before
                being executed for treason. Mary I's reign was short as well and once she died Elizabeth became Queen.
            </p>
            <h2>Elizabeth and Religion</h2>
            <p>Like her brother before her, Elizabeth was a staunch Protestant. Her father had changed the primary
                religion
                of England before her birth and therefore she grew up in a Protestant environment. However, Elizabeth
                was
                more lenient than previous monarchs over the religion of her people. Catholics and Protestants could
                both
                practice <em>simultaneously</em>. This was quite radical for the time period as there was religious
                conflict
                throughout mainland Europe as well as in England during Mary I's reign. </p>
            <h2>Marriage</h2>
            <p>Unlike her father, Elizabeth I never married. She was nicknamed the 'Virgin Queen' because of this. Being
                a
                woman in power during the 1500s, she probably didn't marry in order to maintain her control, but it is
                also
                possible that her father's track record in unions turned her off of such a contract. That is not to say
                that
                Elizabeth didn't have her fair share of relationships. Her most well-known partner was Robert Dudley, a
                childhood friend who would remain in her affections for her whole life. Their was a period of time where
                Elizabeth was intent on marrying Dudley, however her advisors were against it and it would have shook
                the
                foundations of her power to do so. Because she remained unmarried, the Tudor monarchy ended with
                Elizabeth
                I. </p>
