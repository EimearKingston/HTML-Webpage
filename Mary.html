            <h2>Childhood</h2>
            <p>Mary I was born in February of 1516 to parents Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon. She was the first
                child of
                King Henry VIII. Mary was baptised as a Catholic as that was still the primary religion of England at
                the
                time. Like her half-sister Elizabeth, Mary was incredibly well educated. Throughout her childhood the
                princess was betrothed numerous times in order to form alliances. Many were dissolved however. When
                Henry
                divorced her mother, Mary was declared illegitimate and was demoted to 'The Lady Mary' and her
                birthright to
                the crown was rescinded.</p>
            <h2>Succession</h2>
            <p>After the death of King Henry VIII, Mary I had a tumultuous climb to the throne. Her younger half-brother
                Edward ruled for only <em>three</em> years before his death, after which she should have ascended into
                power.
                However
                the <i>Act of Succession</i> that had been written in Henry's final days was ignored. This Act is what
                would
                have
                given Mary her right to the crown. The confusion led to a cousin, Lady Jane Grey, being appointed
                monarch.
                This reign was short-lived as the princess did not easily give up her succession rights. Grey only ruled
                for
                nine days before being executed for treason by Mary.</p>
            
            <h2>Reign</h2>
            <p>Mary ascended to the throne in 1553. During the course of her ruling as Queen of England, the princess
                became
                known as <b>'Bloody Mary'</b>. This was
                because of her ruthlessness towards Protestants. Mary reinstated Catholicism as the religion of England,
                having spent her formative years practicing said religion as opposed to Protestantism. She authorized
                hundreds of burnings of heretics and was strict in her enforcement of religious law. She was concerned
                that
                if Protestants were allowed to practice and congregate in England then they may plot to overthrow her
                and
                place her half-sister Elizabeth in her stead. To ensure her control would remain steadfast the Queen
                searched for a husband so that an heir could be produced and displace Elizabeth from the royal line of
                succession. Mary married the Spanish prince Philip. She suffered through quite a few 'phantom'
                pregnancies.
                until it became apparent that no heir would be born. She died in 1558 at the age of 42, whereupon her
                sister
                Elizabeth was crowned. </p>
