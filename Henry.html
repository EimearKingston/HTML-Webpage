            <h2>Childhood</h2>
            <p>Henry VIII was born on 28th June 1491 in the Palace of Placentia in Kent, England. He was born to King
                Henry
                VII and Queen Elizabeth. Being the second son, it was never expected that Henry would ascend to the
                throne,
                however he still received a high-quality education. Henry ultimately became the only option for the next
                monarch after his older brother, Arthur, died at age 15.</p>
            <h2>Marriages of King Henry VIII</h2>
            <p>The marriages of King Henry VIII are famed for their brutality and for the sheer number of unions that
                took
                place during his reign. In total, Henry VIII married <b>six</b> times. Almost every marriage was
                controversial, with his first even establishing Protestantism in England.</p>

                <h3>Catherine of Aragon:</h3>

                <p>Catherine of Aragon (top left) was born in 1485 near Madrid to King Ferdinand II and Queen Isabella.
                    Before her
                    marriage to Henry VIII, she had previously been married to his brother Arthur for about only 20
                    weeks
                    before the heir's death. Issues with Catherine's dowry meant that a second marriage, this time to
                    Henry
                    was proposed. However, there was a great deal of controversy surrounding the union. England at the
                    time
                    was strictly Catholic and followed papal law, which included laws forbidding the marriage of one's
                    brother's widow. Henry managed to obtain a dispensation, allowing him to marry Catherine due to the
                    shortness of the previous marriage. They later divorced because Catherine had failed to provide a
                    son
                    and heir, and was now in Henry's opinion 'too old' for any possibility of an heir. The couple did
                    however have a daughter, who would become known as 'Bloody Mary' during her reign.</p>
                <h3>Anne Boleyn:</h3>

                <p>Anne Boleyn (bottom left) was born in 1501 to Thomas Boleyn and Lady Elizabeth Howard in Norfolk.
                    Anne entered into the
                    service of Catherine of Aragon during the Queen's marriage to Henry VIII. It was during this time
                    that
                    Anne Boleyn became acquainted with the king. After Henry's divorce in 1533, he and Anne married much
                    to
                    public dismay. Anne was said to have had three pregnancies during the short three years of marriage,
                    but
                    only one baby survived and was a daughter. Talks began of another divorce. Eventually, the Queen was accused of adultery and witchcraft
                    and
                    was beheaded. It was said that every year on the anniversary of her execution hares ran wild in the
                    country side - signifying her guilt as a witch.</p>
                <h3>Jane Seymour:</h3>

                <p>Jane Seymour (top middle) was born circa 1508 to parents Sir John Seymour and Margaret Wentworth.
                    Like Anne Boleyn,
                    Jane Seymour was in the service of Catherine of Aragon as a lady-in-waiting, and later entered
                    Anne's
                    service as well. She is said to have been the favourite wife of Henry VIII because she was the only
                    partner who gave him a legitimate male heir. Their union was cut short however because Jane did not
                    survive the strenuous childbirth. Upon Henry's death in 1547, he was buried alongside Seymour. She
                    was
                    the only wife to have received a proper Queen's funeral.</p>

                <h3>Anne of Cleves:</h3>

                <p>Anne of Cleves (bottom middle) was born in 1515 to John III and his wife Duchess Maria in DÃ¼sseldorf.
                    Henry was
                    considering his choice for the next queen and was sent a portrait of Anne by Hans Holbein the
                    Younger.
                    Upon seeing the portrait, the king decided to marry Anne. However the union was short-lived and they
                    divorced that same year. It is rumored that the portrait made by Holbein illustrated the noblewoman
                    in a
                    more 'flattering' light than what was true. Many people believe that Anne's appearance is what
                    caused
                    the annulment of the marriage. However, a friendship grew between the king and his divorced wife, so
                    much so that she became known as the 'King's Sister' and received properties and funds from the
                    crown.
                </p>
                <h3>Catherine Howard:</h3>

                <p>Catherine Howard (top right) was the youngest wife of Henry VIII. She was born around 1521 to parents
                    Thomas Howard
                    and Joyce Culpeper. Following her predecessors, Catherine was a lady-in-waiting to the queen at the
                    time, which was Anne of Cleves. It was here that she met King Henry VIII. They married soon after
                    meeting, Henry being <em>49</em> and Catherine still a <em>teenager</em>. Catherine Howard's reign as queen consort
                    was
                    reminiscent of that of Anne Boleyn, featuring lavish dresses and jewellery. Like Boleyn, accusations
                    of
                    adultery led to an early death for Howard. She was found guilty of treason against the crown for
                    pre-marital relationships, as well as suspicions of being unfaithful during the royal union. When
                    she
                    was executed, Catherine was buried in an unmarked grave.</p>
                <h3>Catherine Parr:</h3>

                <p>Catherine Parr (bottom right) was the last wife of Henry VIII, born around 1512 to Sir Thomas Parr
                    and Maud Parr. She
                    married twice before eventually marrying the king, having been widowed both times. Parr entered into
                    Princess Mary's household and it was here that she was introduced to Henry. Despite fielding
                    multiple
                    proposals, Catherine accepted the king's offer because of her 'duty'. Henry often trusted her with
                    ruling as regent in his absence. Catherine also forged strong relationships with the estranged
                    princesses Mary and Elizabeth and aided their return to court. The Queen did have one or two close calls in receiving the same fate as her immediate predecessor. Catherine was the only wife to outlive Henry.</p>

        <h3>Henry VIII and the Catholic Church</h3>
        <p>When Henry wanted to divorce his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, there was strong opposition from the
            Pope in Rome. This is because of the special dispensation that had been given to Henry in order to marry
            his brother's widow. The king wanted to have the marriage dissolved and branded as illegitimate for the
            very law he was fighting against in the first place. However this time the Catholic Church did not
            oblige resulting in a split between the kingdom of England and Rome. Henry VIII established
            Protestantism as the primary religion of England. This marked the beginning of the <i>Reformation</i> in
            Britain. This is one of the most notable changes that took place during the Tudor period. While Henry
            was not overtly strict over the practice of Catholicism, his children would bring about a tumultuous
            relationship between religion and the crown because of this split.</p>
